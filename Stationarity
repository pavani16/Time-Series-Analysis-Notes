In the world of time-series data, like we had people of various personalities and skills we assign different people with different jobs based on their skills.
What ???
Similarly, stationary time series data is a type of time series where constant mean, variance and autocorrelation is observed along with no periodic component.
WHY ??
So, this stationary person is important for forecasting models. Because , this is fundamental assumption about the data before it is modelled. 
Even if the data is not stationary, we can make it work by transforming it into stationary.

ENEMIES:
Naturally stationary time series opponent would be Non Stationary time series and yes NonStationary Time Series have exactly the opposite features of Stationary Time Series.

HOW ??
Now that we got to know about these two differnt types of data , let us see how can we identify these guys in our datasets. 
Several WAYS:
1. Run Sequence Plots
2. Summary Statistics
3. Histogram plot
4. Augmented Dickey-Fuller test(ADF)


DEFINITIONS:
AutoCorrelation - correlation between a observation made at two different timestamps.
